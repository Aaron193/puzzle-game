# Puzzle Rush


## About
Puzzle Rush is a web-based puzzle game that was designed for the 2023 Technology Student Association's annual Game-Design competition. The game was developed by a group of dedicated artists and coders, ultimately winning 2nd place at the state-level competition.

## How to Play
There are three levels to the game: Easy, Medium, and Hard. The harder the level, the quicker you have to be in solving the puzzle.
After selecting a level, you will be greeted with three back-to-back puzzles. Each puzzle you will need to solve before the timer runs out. To solve the puzzle, drag pieces to their appropriate location. If the puzzle piece is in the correct location, it will be locked onto the board. Otherwise, the puzzle piece's location will be randomized. To correctly seal in a puzzle piece, there must be an adjacent piece already solved. Each puzzle will start with the top left piece in the correct place. Have fun, and good luck.
